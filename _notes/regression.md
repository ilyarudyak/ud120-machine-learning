### theory

- in some cases it's difficult to differentiate between
discrete and continuous models: CONTINUOUS - age, income;
DISCRETE - weather, phone, author of the email;

- finally I understood that `slope` is just `a` coefficient
and `b` is an `intercept` in `y = ax + b`;

- we use R^2 metric (instead of accuracy_score) - `reg.score()`;
SSE is not normalized (bigger number of point gives us bigger SSE);

- how to visualize? (a) plot the line and the scatter plot of data; 
(b) plot errors; visualization is useful to understand if it's 
possible to get a good linear regression on given data;
